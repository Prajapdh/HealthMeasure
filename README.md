# HealthMeasure
A simple ML-powered tool to measure a person's wellness

# Inspiration
While BMI is a popular tool for measuring health around the world, it is also inaccurate due to inaccurate measurements of body fat content and muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and racial and sex differences was not considered.

# What it does
Health Measure aims to create a more accurate measurement of wellness 

# How we built it
We used Jupyter Notebook to create a linear regression model to measure the impact of each health factor and SQL server to store patients' data

# Challenges we ran into
Determining the best factors for measuring health and their impact

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The model can correctly measure a personâ€™s health with root mean square error of 142 out of 1000, which was relatively useful

# What we learned
We had learned how to work on ML integration with SQL server

# What's next for HealthMeasure
Currently, we have only created health indicators for diabetes. Thus, we aim to expand this model to support more health conditions and gain a better understanding of people's well-being.
